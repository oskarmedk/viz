<p>The application relies on Google infrastructure such as Google Play Store and the Android operating System. For more information, refer to https://policies.google.com/privacy</p>
<p>To enable download and sharing of user data (media files for questions and answers as well as playlists), the app uses Google Firebase. For more information, refer to https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/<p>
<p>The application uses Firebase Authentication for authentication of users to handle ownership of shared data. Firebase Dynamic Links as a mechanism to generate links to shared data. Cloud Firestore as dataase and Cloud Storage for Firebase for storage of user data.

<p><strong>Storage of user data</strong></p>
<p>Media data recorded within the application such as Questions and Answers are stored in an application specific folder on your physical device. The Android operating system prohibits access to these files for purposes outside the Viz application itself.</p>
    
<p><strong>Sharing user data</strong></p>
<p>As an explicit action only available to users who pass a parent check, user data such as questions, answers and playlists can be shared with other users. This will make the data public and anyone aware of the URL can access the data.</p>

    has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
    are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
